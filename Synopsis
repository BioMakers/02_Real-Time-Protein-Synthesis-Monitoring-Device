Our lab works on understanding how ribosomes are put together from their component parts and how this process is regulated by the cell. In this project we aim to design a tool for monitoring protein synthesis (translation) in vitro. We aim to design a simple device that will allow for the tracking of translation dynamics, which can be used for the discovery of novel translation-inhibiting or activation molecules and ribosome profiling for biophysical or structural studies. The device could also be used for teaching purposes and will serve as a prototype for a diagnostic device for the preliminary/quick detection of ribosomopathies, i.e. inherited disorders characterized by the disruption in the ribosome assembly pathway and low protein synthesis capacity - an emerging class of human developmental and cancer predisposition disorders.
